## Adapter design pattern

# The adapter design pattern is a structural design patter that allows object with incompatible interface to collaborate.
# It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

## when to use adapter 

# Integarting legacy code with new system
# Third-party library implementation with different interfaces
# Refactoring existing code without breaking client code
